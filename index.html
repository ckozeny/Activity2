    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="ella.jpg" alt="Ella and Me" height="250px" width="20%">
    <p>Hello! My name is Cj Kozeny. I'm an MIS major here at UNO and this year I am a senior. I've always had an interest in the information sciences and a nagging curiosity of how things work and operate. I get satisfaction from taking things apart and learning about their inner workings - maybe this drive is what influenced me to pursue this type of career. In my free time i love to be with friends and family, snowboard when the weather permits, and be out in the sun as much as possible. </p>

    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>My education in these topics has mostly been provided by the university. I've also learned a good chunk of my skills through curiosity and trial and error. I started with modifying Xbox controllers for my friends to shoot at rapid speeds, onto installing car audio and amplifiers, and finally onto system development and database management. I find pride in expanding my knowledge every day, and hope to continue that with this course.</p>

    <h1>Recreation</h1>
    <p>I choose to spend my free time doing a lot of different activities. Most of them involve being active or working with problems and finding viable solutions. I like to work on cars and ride ro drive anything with a motor. I have a cabin that i frequent almost every summer weekend, and spend a majority of my time there. I'll try anything once!</p>
